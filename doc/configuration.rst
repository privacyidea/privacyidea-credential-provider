Configuration
=============

During installation of the privacyIDEA Credential Provider you already
configured all necessary settings, but it can be interesting to change
settings later. Like changing the available credential providers or changing
the verification of the authentication server certificate.

Registry Settings
-----------------

If you want to change the configuration after the installation, you can only do this by editing the registry keys.
You can use administrative templates to deploy the credential provider on many desktops in your network.

The configuration is located at
``Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NetKnights GmbH\PrivacyIDEA-CP\``.


NOTE: If an entry is missing, you can just create a new entry of type REG_SZ with the corresponding name.

Connection Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings define the connection to the privacyIDEA server.
The connection is established via https by default, like indicated in the installer.

**hostname**

The hostname of the privacyIDEA Authentication Service. That usually is something
like  *yourserver.example.com* without any additional path information.

**path**

The path to the privacyIDEA Authentication Service if there is.
E.g. */test/path/pi*

NOTE: The entry */path/to/pi* is a placeholder. If it is read by the Credential Provider, it is treated as an empty entry.

**ssl_ignore_invalid_cn**

Set to ``1`` if the privacyIDEA Credential Provider should ignore SSL errors originating from an invalid common name.

**ssl_ignore_unknown_ca**

Set to ``1`` if the privacyIDEA Credential Provider should ignore SSL errors originating from an unknown CA.

**custom_port**

This entry is not there by default. You can add it to declare a custom port. The value has to be of type *REG_SZ* with the name *custom_port*.

NOTE: By default the port is the default https port, which is 443.

**resolve_timeout, connect_timeout, send_timeout, receive_timeout**

With these entries you can specify the timeout (in ms) for the corresponding phase. This might be interesting if the offline feature
is used. The default timeouts are infinite / 60s / 30s / 30s.

Login behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using these settings you can specify the behaviour of the privacyIDEA Credential Provider. The credential provider
can ask for the username, the password and the otp value in one step or in two steps.

**enable_filter**

This setting is introduced in v3.2. Set this to ``1`` to disable all other Credential Providers so that only this one will be usable.

**two_step_hide_otp**

Set to ``1`` if the privacyIDEA Credential Provider should ask for the user's OTP in a second step. In the first step the user will only be asked for the password.

**two_step_send_password**

Set to ``1`` if the privacyIDEA Credential Provider should send the user's password to the privacyIDEA Authentication Service.

**two_step_send_empty_password**

Set to ``1`` if the privacyIDEA Credential Provider should send an empty password to the privacyIDEA Authentication Service.

NOTE: If both **two_step_send_password** and **two_step_send_empty_password** are set to ``1``, the privacyIDEA Credential Provider will send an empty password to the privacyIDEA Authentication Service.
NOTE: Sending the windows or an empty password can be used to trigger token types like SMS, Email or Push.

**excluded_account**

Specify an account that should be excluded from 2FA. The format is required to be ``domain\username`` or ``computername\username``.

**send_upn**
Set to ``1`` to send the UPN instead of username and domain to privacyIDEA.The determination if the username input is a UPN is currently very basic and will assume an UPN if there is an @ and no \ contained in the input.
If the input is not an UPN, the usual realm settings are applied.

**otp_fail_return_to_first_step**
Set to ``1`` to return to the first step (entering password) after entering a wrong OTP. Default is ``0``, so after entering a wrong OTP, you are prompted for the OTP again.

Filter
~~~~~~
The Filter is an additional component of a credential provider. It can be used to filter out other credential providers (e.g. the system ones).
By default, if our filter is enabled, it will filter every other credential provider so that the privacyIDEA CP is the only one usable.

**enable_filter**
Set this to ``1`` to enable the filter of the privacyIDEA Credential Provider. If this is disabled, the privacyIDEA CP will just be listed **in addition**
to the other existing CPs.

**filter_whitelist**
Add entries to this REG_MULTI_SZ to spare other CPs from being filtered. The entry has to be the CLSID of a CP.
One way to check the CLSID of a CP is to look at
**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Authentication\\Credential Providers**

Configuration for specific scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different *credential provider usage scenarios* ("cpus"). The available
scenarios are **logon**, **unlock** and **credui**.

It is possible to configure both the Credential Provider and the Filter for each of the scenarios.
This way the administrator can define a different behaviour if a users either logs in or
unlocks his desktop.

For the configurations in this section to take effect, the **enable_filter** setting has to be enabled in v3.2 or higher.

The behaviour in each scenario can be configured via the corresponding registry
entry named **cpus_logon**, **cpus_unlock** and **cpus_credui**.

These entries expect a *REG_SZ*, that consist of a digit 0, 1, 2, 3 and a
character "e" or "d".

* 0: relevant for *remote* (RDP) and *local* operation
* 1: relevant for *remote* operation
* 2: relevant for *local* operation
* 3: the privacyIDEA Credential Provider will **not** be shown in *remote* and *local* operation.

The characters stand for:

* "e": Only the privacyIDEA Credential Provider is available. All other
  credential providers are not available.
* "d": The privacyIDEA Credential Provider will be available *in addition* to all other Credential Providers on the machine.

E.g. This would result in:

* ``cpus_logon = 0e``: Only the privacyIDEA Credential Provider is available for
  Logon via remote and locally.

* ``cpus_unlock = 1d``: Remotely the locked destop can be unlocked with all
  available Credential Providers, including the privacyIDEA Credential Provider.

* ``cpus_unlock = 2e``: Locally unlocking the desktop is only possible with the
  privacyIDEA Credential Provider.

* ``cpus_credui = 3d``: For credui scenarios, the privacyIDEA Credential Provider
  is disabled and will not be shown, no matter if remotely or locally. Only the other
  credential providers are available.
  (Note: "3e" does not exist, because there would be no credential provider available)

If there is no entry for a scenario, the default is assumed:
The privacyIDEA Credential Provider will be available and the Filter will be active, if installed.

**NOTE: Starting with Windows 10, CPUS_UNLOCK is not triggered by default anymore when unlocking the workstation. Instead, unlocking the workstation is considered CPUS_LOGON. If you need to differentiate the two scenarios, disabling fast user switching in the group policy editor restores the previous behavior. An example of how to do this can be found here:** https://support.waters.com/KB_Inf/Empower_Breeze/WKB47366_How_To_Enable_Disable_Fast_User_Switching_In_Windows_10
**NOTE: To use the Credential Provider in CredUI Scenarios on Priviliged Access Workstations with Admin Accounts see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpsb/341747f5-6b5d-4d30-85fc-fa1cc04038d4**

Recommended setup for remote desktop scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In scenarios where the privacyIDEA Credential Provider is to be used for RDP connections, it is recommended to install the privacyIDEA Credential Provider only on the RDP target.
The Filter has to be enabled for RDP scenarios, otherwise Windows will use the System Credential Provider automatically!
It is also recommended to use the *two_step_hide_otp* setting to skip entering the windows password a second time.


Customization of the Look and Feel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also change the look and feel of the privacyIDEA Credential Provider.


**login_text**

Specify the text that is displayed underneath the credential logo and on the right side where available credentials are listed.
The default is "privacyIDEA Login".

**otp_text**

Speficy the text that is displayed in the OTP input field. Usually this is "One-Time Password", but you can
change it to any other value you like.

**otp_hint_text**

Speficy the text that is displayed when prompted to enter the OTP in the second step.
The default is "Please enter your second factor!".

**otp_fail_text**

Specify a custom text that is shown when the OTP verification failed. The default is "Wrong One-Time Password!".
NOTE: An error on either the client or server side overwrites this message.

**hide_domainname**

Set to ``1`` if you want the privacyIDEA Credential Provider to hide only the domain name when the desktop is locked.

**hide_fullname**

Set to ``1`` if you want the privacyIDEA Credential Provider to hide the user and domain name when the desktop is locked.
Instead only the contents of the *login_text* settings will be displayed.

**v1_bitmap_path**

The complete path and filename of a bitmap image. This is a customized
login image. The image must be a version 3 Windows BMP file with a resolution
of 128x128 pixels.

**no_default**

Add this registry entry and set it ``1`` to **not** have the privacyIDEA Credential Provider selected by default when logging in.

**show_domain_hint**

Set this to ``1`` to show the domain that is currently used to log in.

**prefill_username**

Set this to ``1`` to have the username field prefilled with the user that last logged on.

**enable_reset**

Set this to ``1`` to have a clickable text shown at the bottom which will reset the login.

**reset_link_text**

Set this to change the text for reset link. The default is "Reset Login".

**otp_link_text**

Set this to overwrite the text to switch from webauthn to OTP mode. Default is "Use One-Time-Password".


WebAuthn
~~~~~~~~
To use WebAuthn, it is required to configure **two_step_hide_otp** and either of the other **two_step_send** options to trigger a challenge!
NOTE: CURRENTLY SUPPORTS ONLY A SINGLE CONNECTED FIDO2 DEVICE. IF MORE THAN ONE DEVICE IS CONNECTED, THE "FIRST ENUMERATED" WILL BE USED, WHICH IS A NON-DETERMINISTIC SELECTION!
NOTE: AFTER YOU ARE PROMPTED TO TOUCH YOUR SECURITY KEY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CANCEL THE OPERATION. EVENTHOUGH THERE IS A CANCEL BUTTON, THE CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO THE DEVICE UNTIL THE OPERATION IS COMPLETED!
NOTE: WINDOWS HELLO IS NOT SUPPORTED BECAUSE THE UI CAN NOT BE RENDERED IN LOGON/UNLOCK SCENARIOS.

**webauthn_link_text**

Set a custom text to switch the login to security key (webauthn) mode. Default is "Use Security Key".

**webauthn_preferred**

Set to ``1`` to continue directly with webauthn mode after receiving a webauthn challenge. By default, the second step is OTP.

**webauthn_pin_hint**

Set this to overwrite the hint text (which is visible when the input is empty) when asking for the security key PIN. The default is "Security Key PIN".

**webauthn_offline_no_pin**

Set this to ``1`` to not be prompted for the security key PIN when doing offline authentication with WebAuthn. Online authentications remain controlled by privacyIDEA.


Offline token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOTP token can be configured to be usable without a connection to privacyIDEA. On the detail page of the token, select Application => offline at the bottom.
Now the token has to be used online once with the Credential Provider, to get the configured amount of OTPs in advance.
The following settings can be useful with offline token:

**offline_file**

Specify the **absolute** path to where the offline file should be saved. The default is C:\offlineFile.json.
NOTE: Either txt or json file type is recommended.

**offline_try_window**

Specify how many offline values shall be compared to the input at max. Default is 10. A value of 0 equals the default.

**offline_threshold**

Specify the number of remaining OTP values below which a refill should be attempted. Refilling is done online and therefore requires a connection to the server.
If the machine is really offline and refill is attempted, this will cause a timeout and thus slow down the login. 
By default, refill is attempted after every successful offline authentication. However, if 100 offline values are available, it is not neccessary to try refilling after every authentication.

**offline_show_info**

Set this to ``1`` to show information about available offline token for the current user. This will trigger as soon as the input from the username field matches a user for which offline token are available.


Realms
~~~~~~

Realms are implemented by mapping Windows domains to privacyIDEA realms. When a matching mapping exists, the &realm=... parameter
is added to the request.

**default_realm**

Specify a default realm. If set, it is appended to every request that has no other matching mapping.


The mapping is done in the sub key ``realm-mapping`` (=> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Netknights GmbH\\PrivacyIDEA-CP\\realm-mapping).
Here you can specify the Windows domains as the names and the privacyIDEA realms as data of REG_SZ entries.


Log file
~~~~~~~~

**debug_log**

Set to ``1`` if you want the privacyIDEA Credential Provider to write a detailed log file, which is helpful when reporting bugs.
The log file is located at C:\\PICredentialProviderLog.txt.
If this setting is disabled, actual errors are still written to the log file.

**log_sensitive**

In some cases it can be useful to log sensitive data (e.g. passwords) to find the cause of a problem. 
By default, sensitive data is not logged. Instead it is only logged if the password contains a value.
To log sensitive data aswell, create a new registry key of type *REG_SZ* with the name *log_sensitive* and a value of *1*. This can be deleted after creating a log file.
